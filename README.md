# Steph-s-Amazing-Day-Scheduler

In this day scheduler, I planned on making an app that was easy to use for scheduling your days. After running into various issues, I was able to complete it. I started by building the HTML using Bootstrap, and making the column layout look the same as what was shown in the demo project, and making sure it works with the CSS classes that were give. Then, I focused on displaying the date on screen using the Date API, and then also changing the column backround colors using this API with the clases that were given to us. FInally, and what I struggled with the most, is using local storage to save values to the screen after reload. After finally being able to do this, I competed the project.
